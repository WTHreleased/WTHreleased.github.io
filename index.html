        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, my time is split between family, work, and other
          interests. At home I spend most my free time with my wifeand taking
          care of our animal babies, including our precious chihuahua, Tikky,
          and an ever increasing number of reptiles. I am also a care provider
          for my father.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I may have missed my calling in the field of computer programming, but
          I love it and lose myself in it. As a child working in DOS on my IBM
          8088, it was clear I had a proclivity for technology. Soon I was
          building computers for a neighbor to get components for my own
          computer. I was first exposed to programming languages,Logo and
          Pascal; and I remember the joy of seeing code come to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now at age 47 with many responsiblities demanding my time, I can't
          imagine I will ever be able to make it a career. Nonetheless, I am
          pursuing it as a hobby for my own pleasure and well-being.
