          My name is Billy, and this site is my journey into web development. I
          will be posting my projects here for you to see and as a record of my
          progress. I welcome your feedback and support as I continue to learn
          and grow in this field.

          I may I have missed my calling in the field of computer programming,
          but I love it and lose myself in it. As a child working in DOS on my
          IBM 8088, it was clear I had a proclivity for technology. In school
          was exposed to the Logo and Pascal programming languages, and it was
          Now at age 47 with many responsiblities demanding my time, I can't
          imagine I will ever be able to make it a career. Nonetheless, I am
          pursuing it as a hobby for my own pleasure and well-being.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, my time is split between family, work, and other
          interests. I work with Human Rights Watch advocating for second
          chances and criminal system reform. Please visit BeyondLWOP.org for to
          learn more about my work and to see my first venture into web
          development. At home I spend most my free time with my wifeand taking
          care of our animal babies, including our precious chihuahua, Tikky,
          and an ever increasing number of reptiles. I am also a care provider
          for my father.
